finance is a social challenge
if you've ever been in a serious relationship, finance budgeting and spending can be

I want to build a solution that is socially driven addressing typical scenarios of budgeting, analysis and improving planning

I'm a consulting engineer at Turner and lead instructor at Georgia Tech Prof Ed Full Stack bootcamp. I have one of my top students with me tonight and we are looking
for 2-3 more persons to support our team through the weekend. We need at least a business person who is capable of thinking through real social scenarios and preferably with
some real world experience in a serious relationship involving personal finance.

your name
the problem and who it is for
your solution its name and why it is unique
who do need on your team



### NOTES
rewards and punishments needed
incentivizing savings is an ineffective and expensive strategy

budgeting vs goals

cash flow is volatile
budgeting tools now assume expenses and income are fixed monthly

app says  "we saw your cash flow drop by X%... recommended actions to adjust"


zenspend - spend and save in harmony

targeting LMI segment (low to moderate income) - 1 in 3 americans
secondary targeting financial institutions

LMI spend A LOT on (bad) financial services - e.g. check cashing, bill pay, predatory lending, instant tax refunds

but LMI have smart phones

LMI work at Porsche, Mercedes Benz... lets build personas/presentations to destroy stereotypes (Daniel Flores?)

LMI are expert money managers but are powerless against volatile cash flow and behavior triggers

pacifica, lantern tools on market addressing mental health and behavioral strategies and CBT

LMI millenials are sophisticated
LMI GEN Xers are seeking to buy first home


what you do with little is what you do with lot

/* MY NOTES
looking back at spending behaviors and remarking with qualifications
itemized data pushed and fetched with worldpay
 recurring payments with worldpay
 transaction reviews with tsys
 profile and analysis with alexa
 forecast planning by looking at all members needs by time period (e.g. month to month out 3-6 months)
 anticipate behavior by registering routines
 there are LMI only features (subset of full features)
 there are full feature for fully banked with history
